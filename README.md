# Online Gaming Behavior Analysis

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of online gaming behavior using a comprehensive dataset. The dataset includes various metrics and demographics related to player behavior, game-specific details, engagement metrics, and a target variable reflecting player retention.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset captures the following features:

- **PlayerID**: Unique identifier for each player.
- **Age**: Age of the player.
- **Gender**: Gender of the player.
- **Location**: Geographic location of the player.
- **GameGenre**: Genre of the game the player is engaged in.
- **PlayTimeHours**: Average hours spent playing per session.
- **InGamePurchases**: Indicates whether the player makes in-game purchases (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
- **GameDifficulty**: Difficulty level of the game.
- **SessionsPerWeek**: Number of gaming sessions per week.
- **AvgSessionDurationMinutes**: Average duration of each gaming session in minutes.
- **PlayerLevel**: Current level of the player in the game.
- **AchievementsUnlocked**: Number of achievements unlocked by the player.
- **EngagementLevel**: Categorized engagement level reflecting player retention ('High', 'Medium', 'Low').

This dataset can be found in **Kaggle**: [ðŸŽ® Predict Online Gaming Behavior Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/predict-online-gaming-behavior-dataset) 

## Objectives

1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
2. Identify key factors influencing player engagement levels.
3. Build predictive models to classify player engagement.
4. Analyze feature importance and provide insights for game design optimization.

## Analysis Steps

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Summary statistics of numerical features.
- Distribution plots for age, play time, session duration, etc.
- Correlation matrix to identify relationships between features.

### 2. Predictive Modeling

- Develop models to predict `EngagementLevel` using features like age, gender, location, game genre, play time, etc.
- Models include decision trees, random forests, logistic regression, and neural networks.

### 3. Additional Analysis

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize the performance of the Random Forest model.
- **Model Comparison**: Evaluate different machine learning models including SVM, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.
- **Cross-Validation**: Ensure robustness of the models.

### 4. Summary and Conclusion

- Summarize the findings from the analysis.
- Provide recommendations for future work.
